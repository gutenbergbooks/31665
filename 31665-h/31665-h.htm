<h1>SKIN GAME</h1>

<h2>By Charles E. Fritch</h2>

<p class="hd1">Illustrated by Kelly Freas</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"People are</span> basically alike,"
Harding said democratically. He
sat idly against the strawlike matting
of the hut wall and reached
for a native fruit in a nearby bowl.
"They're all suckers, even the
smartest of them; in fact, the ones
who think they're the smartest
generally wind up to be the dumbest."
Carefully, he bit into the fruit
which resembled an orange and,
mouth full, nodded approvingly.
"Say, these aren't bad. Try one."</p>

<p>Sheckly shook his head, determined
to avoid as many aspects of
this culture as he could. "But these
aren't people," he reminded, not
happy with the thought. "They're
lizards."</p>

<p>Harding shrugged and settled
back, his grinning features ruddy in
the flaring torchlight. "Humanoids
have no monopoly on suckerhood.
When it comes to that, we're all
brothers under the skin, no matter
what color or how hard the skin
may be." He sighed, contemplating
the harvest-to-be. "No, Sheckly, it'll
be like taking candy from a
baby. We'll be out of here with
our pockets bulging before the
Space Patrol can bat an eyelash in
this direction."</p>

<p>Unconvinced, Sheckly stared
glumly through the open doorway
of the hut into the warm humid
night, where a fire flared in the
darkness and long shadows danced
and slithered around it.</p>

<p>"It's not the Space Patrol I'm
worried about," he said, after
a while. "I don't mind fleecing
humanoids&mdash;" he shivered, grimacing&mdash;"but
lizards!"</p>

<p>Harding laughed. "Their riches
are as good as anybody else's. The
trouble with you, Sheckly, you're
too chicken-hearted. If it weren't
for me, you'd still be small-timing
back on Earth. It takes imagination
to get along these days."</p>

<p>Sheckly grunted, for he had no
ready answer to deny this truth.
While he didn't like the reference
to his inability to get along in the
world without Harding's help, the
man was right about other things.
It did take imagination, all right,
mixed with a generous supply of
plain ordinary guts; that, plus an
eye focused unfalteringly on the
good old credit sign.</p>

<p>He certainly could not get along
without Harding's timing. The
man knew just when Patrol Ships
would be at certain spots, knew
their schedules for visiting these
small otherworlds, and always he
was several steps ahead of them.
They went into a planet, their
rocket ship loaded with gambling
devices&mdash;cards, dice, roulette
wheels, and other cultural refinements&mdash;and
set up shop which
could be folded at a moment's
notice if necessary. Natives seemed
almost eager to be skinned of their
riches, and he and Harding happily
obliged them.</p>

<p>"Listen to them out there,"
Harding marveled, leaning forward
to hear the sharp scrapings
that represented music. "They must
be having some kind of ceremony."</p>

<p>Sheckly nodded, shivering slightly,
though the air was hot and
humid. He wished again, as he
often had in the past, he could
have some of Harding's assurance,
some of that unrelenting optimism
that insisted everything would turn
out favorably. But he didn't like
these strange primitive worlds, he
didn't trust them or their inhabitants.
The lizard-people had seemed
friendly enough, but by looking at
a strange reptile you couldn't tell
how far it would jump. When the
Earth ship landed, the creatures
had come slithering to them with
all but a brass band, welcoming the
Earthlings with the hissings that
composed their language. One of
them&mdash;the official interpreter, he
proclaimed himself&mdash;knew a peculiarly
good brand of English, and
welcomed them in a more satisfactory
manner, but still Sheckly
didn't like it. Harding had called
him chicken-hearted, and he felt
a certain amount of justified indignance
at the description. Cautious
would be a better word, he
decided.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">These people</span> appeared
friendly to the Earthlings, but so
did the Earthlings give the appearance
of friendliness to the natives;
that was proof in itself that you
couldn't trust actions to indicate
purpose. But even more than that,
their basic alienness troubled Sheckly
more than he dared admit aloud.
Differences in skin color and modified
body shapes were one thing,
but when a race was on a completely
different evolutionary track
it was a time for caution. These
were a different people, on a different
planet under a different star.
Their customs were strange, how
strange he could yet only guess,
though he preferred not to. This
ceremony now, for example, what
did it mean? A rite for some serpent
god perhaps. A dance in honor
of the Earthmen's arrival. Or it
might just as easily be a preliminary
to a feast at which the visitors
would be the main course.</p>

<p>"I just wish we knew more about
the creatures," he complained, trying
to shove that last thought from
his mind.</p>

<p>Harding looked annoyed, as he
drew his attention from the alien
music which had fascinated him.
"Stop worrying, will you? They're
probably among the friendliest
creatures in the universe, even if
they do look like serpents out of
Eden. And the friendly ones rate
A-1 on my sucker-list."</p>

<p>Sheckly shuddered and cast an
annoyed glance into the night.
"How can anybody concentrate
with that infernal racket going on
out there? Don't they ever sleep?"</p>

<p>"Patience," Harding advised
calmly, "is a noble virtue. Ah, here
comes our interpreter."</p>

<p>Sheckly started involuntarily, as
a scaley head thrust itself into the
hut. The serpentman had a long
sharp knife gleaming in one hand.
"Pardon, sirs," the head said slurringly,
as a forked tongue sorted
over the unfamiliar syllables. "The
leader wishes to know will you join
us?"</p>

<p>"No, thanks," Sheckly said, staring
at the knife.</p>

<p>Harding said, "We should join
them. We don't want to offend
these creatures, and if we're real
friendly we might make out better."</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> go out then. I'm going to
see if I can get some sleep."</p>

<p>Harding shrugged, his glance
making it plain he knew Sheckly
lacked nerve more than sleep. To
the serpentman he said, "Tell your
leader my companion is tired from
our long journey and would rest
now. However, I will be happy to
join you."</p>

<p>"Yesss," the serpent head hissed
and withdrew.</p>

<p>"Boy, will I be glad to get out of
here," Sheckly muttered.</p>

<p>"Sometimes I wonder why I ever
teamed up with a pansy like you,
Sheckly," Harding said harshly, a
disgusted look on his face. "There
are times when I regret it." He
turned and walked from the hut.</p>

<p>Sheckly stared bitterly after him.
He felt no anger at the denunciation,
only a plaguing irritableness,
an annoyance with both Harding
and himself. He should have gone
out there with Harding, if only to
show the man that he was not
afraid, that he was no coward. And
yet, as he sat there listening to the
strange sounds creeping across the
warm dampness, he made no move
to rise, and he knew he would not.</p>

<p>Grunting disgustedly, Sheckly
stretched out on the floor matting
and tried to think of other things.
He stared at the orange-flaring
torch and contemplated putting it
out, but the sounds from the outside
drifted in upon him and
changed his mind. After a while, he
closed his eyes and dozed.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">He woke</span> suddenly and sat upright,
a cold sweat making him
tremble. What had wakened him?
he wondered. He had the vague
notion that someone had screamed,
yet he wasn't sure. In the faltering
torchlight, he could see Harding
had not returned. He listened intently
to the noises outside, the
scraping, the hissing, the slithering.
No screams came.</p>

<div class="figr"><img src="images/001.png" width="357" height="550" alt="" title="" /></div>

<p>I'm not going to stay here, he
told himself. I'll leave tomorrow, I
don't care what Harding says. I'll
go crazy if I have to spend another
night like this. Exhausted, he fell
asleep.</p>

<p>Morning came, and the alien sun
slanted orange rays through the
cabin doorway. Sheckly opened his
eyes and stared at the thatched
roof. The torch had burned out,
but it was no longer needed for
light. Thank goodness for morning,
he thought. Morning brought a
temporary sanity to this world, and
after the madness of the night it
was a reprieve he welcomed gladly.
He had not opposed Harding
till now, but desperation was a
strong incentive to rebellion. When
Harding returned&mdash; Startled, he
considered the thought. <i>When</i>
Harding returned?</p>

<p>He sat up and stared around
him. Harding was not in sight.
Panic came, and he leaped up,
blood racing, as though to defend
himself against invisible enemies.
Perhaps he'd gotten up early,
Sheckly thought. But suppose he
hadn't returned? Suppose&mdash;</p>

<p>He jumped, as the interpreter
entered the hut behind him. "The
Leader wishes you to join him for
eating," the serpentman said.</p>

<p>"No," Sheckly said hastily. They
weren't going to make a meal out
of him. "No, thanks. Look, I've got
to leave your planet. Leave, understand?
Right away."</p>

<p>"The leader wishes you to join
him," the creature repeated. This
time the sword crept into his hands.</p>

<p>Sheckly stared at the sword, and
his heart leaped. He thought there
was a tinge of red on the blade's
edge. Mentally, he shook his head.
No, it was his imagination again.
Just imagination. Still, the drawn
sword clearly indicated that the
invitation was not to be refused.</p>

<p>"All right," he said weakly. "All
right, in a few minutes."</p>

<p>"Now," the other said.</p>

<p>"Okay, now," the Earthling
agreed listlessly. "Where is my companion?"</p>

<p>"You will see him," the creature
promised.</p>

<p>Sheckly breathed a sigh of relief
at that. Harding was probably all
right then. It made him feel better,
though it would make the task
of leaving much harder.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">They had</span> arrived at twilight
the previous day, so they hadn't
the opportunity to see the village
in its entirety. They hadn't missed
much, Sheckly realized as he
walked along, for the grouped huts
were unimpressive, looking somewhat
like a primitive African village
back on Earth. But the Earthling
would have preferred the most
primitive Earth native to these serpents.
In the distance, the slim nose
of the rocket ship pointed the way
to freedom, and Sheckly looked
longingly at it.</p>

<p>At one end of the village was a
small mountain of what appeared
to be plastic clothing, milkily translucent&mdash;which
was strange, since
these creatures wore no clothing.
The Earthling wondered at this
but did not ask about it. Other
thoughts more important troubled
him.</p>

<p>"In here," the interpreter told
him, stopping before the largest
hut.</p>

<p>Hesitating briefly, Sheckly entered
and the creature followed him
in. Seated on the floor were the
leader and his mate and several
smaller reptiles that evidently were
the children. Between them lay
several bowls of food. Sheckly
grimaced and turned hastily away
as he saw small crawling insects in
one bowl.</p>

<p>"Sit down," the interpreter directed.</p>

<p>Harding was not in evidence.
"Where is my companion?" he
asked.</p>

<p>The interpreter conferred briefly
with the leader, then told Sheckly,
"He could not come. Sit down&mdash;eat."</p>

<p>Sheckly sat down, but he didn't
feel like eating. He wondered <i>why</i>
Harding could not come. At a
sudden thought, he said, "I have
rations on my ship&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Eat," the interpreter said, gripping
his sword.</p>

<p>Sheckly nodded weakly and
reached out for the bowl of fruit,
taking one that resembled that
which Harding had eaten the previous
night. It wasn't bad. The
leader stuffed a fistful of squirming
insects in his mouth and offered the
bowl to Sheckly, who shook his
head as politely as he could and
indicated the fruit in his hand.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the serpentman did
not insist on his taking anything
other than fruit, so the meal passed
without physical discomfort.</p>

<p>When they were through, the
leader hissed several syllables to
the interpreter, who said, "The
leader wishes to see your games.
You will set them up now."</p>

<p>Sheckly ran his tongue over dry
lips. "They're in the ship," he said,
and eagerness crept into his voice.
"I'll have to get them." Once inside
the ship, he'd never come back.
He'd slam the airlock door and bolt
it and then blast off as fast as he
could get the motors going, Harding
or no Harding. He got up.</p>

<p>"We will help you," the interpreter
said.</p>

<p>"No. I can do it myself."</p>

<p>"We will help you," the interpreter
insisted firmly. His eyes
bored into the Earthling, as though
daring him to refuse again.</p>

<p>Sheckly's mouth felt dry once
more. "Where's Harding?" he demanded.
"Where's the other Earth
man? What have you done with
him?"</p>

<p>The interpreter looked at the
leader, who nodded. The interpreter
said gravely, "It is too bad.
It is the season for the shedding of
skins. At the shedding feast last
night&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The shedding of skins!" Sheckly
said, remembering the pile he'd
seen at one corner of the village;
"those translucent things were your
cast-off skins." He recalled that
some reptiles back on Earth had
regular seasons of shedding. That
intelligent creatures should do it
made him feel slightly sick.</p>

<p>"Your friend joined us last
night," the serpentman went on.
"But he could not shed properly,
so&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sheckly felt his blood turn to
ice.</p>

<p>"&mdash;so we helped him."</p>

<p>"You <i>what</i>?"</p>

<p>"We helped him out of his skin,"
the serpentman went on calmly.
"We try to help those who are
friends with us. Your friend had
trouble getting his skin off, but
with our help&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No!" the Earthling cried, trying
to reject the thought.</p>

<p>The full realization of what had
happened struck him at once. Despite
himself, he could picture
Harding struggling, trying to convince
these creatures that Earthlings
don't shed their skins. His
struggles must have convinced them
only that he was having trouble
shedding, so they "helped him."
They had come to skin the natives,
but the reverse was happening&mdash;only
literally.</p>

<p>"Where&mdash;where is he?" he asked
finally, though he knew it didn't
really matter.</p>

<p>"We will take you to him," the
interpreter said.</p>

<p>"No," Sheckly cried. "No, I&mdash;I'd
rather not."</p>

<p>The serpentman nodded. "As
you wish. He does not look pretty.
I hope that tonight you do not
have as much trouble."</p>

<p>Sheckly's eyes went wide. "What
do you mean?"</p>

<p>"In your shedding," the serpentman
explained. "We will try to
help you all we can, of course."</p>

<p>"Of course," the Earthling
agreed weakly, licking cottony lips.
He wondered how he could just
stand there so apparently calm, instead
of letting out a shriek and
running as fast as he could for the
rocket ship. He decided it was
some sort of paralysis, the shock
of finding himself in the middle of
something so alien his mind told
him it couldn't possibly be.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Knees wobbling</span>, Sheckly
went to the door and out into
the morning. That he had gotten
that far surprised him pleasantly.
The tall rocket ship was in a clearing
several yards beyond the edge
of the village. He headed for it.
He thought of running, but his
legs felt like rubber, his blood like
ice. He walked past the pile of
drying skins on the ground without
looking at them, and he was
followed by the interpreter and
several others whom the serpentman
had motioned to join them.
Except for their swords, they had
no weapons, he noticed. Poor Harding,
he thought, and wondered if
the Earthling's skin were somewhere
in the pile; he felt sick,
thinking about it.</p>

<p>"You'd better stay outside the
ship," he suggested testily. "I'll
lower the equipment to you."</p>

<p>"I will go aboard with you," the
serpentman said.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I will go aboard with you."</p>

<p>Sheckly shrugged, but he hardly
felt complacent. He felt as though
a giant icy hand held onto his
spine with a firm paralyzing grip.
He trembled visibly. Got to think,
he told himself desperately, got to
plan this out. But fear jumbled
his thoughts, and he could only
think of Harding back in the village
minus his skin, and of what
was going to happen that night if
all went as these creatures planned.</p>

<p>The second thought was the
more terrifying, and when they
were within a hundred feet of the
rocket ship, Sheckly broke into a
frantic run.</p>

<p>"Stop," the interpreter cried.</p>

<p>Sheckly had no intentions of
stopping. His glands told him to
run, and he ran. He ran as fast
as he could and didn't look back.
He imagined the serpentman was
on his heels, knife poised, and he
ran even faster. He reached the
rocket ship and went up the ladder,
scrambling, missing his foothold,
pulling himself up with
clutching hands. He threw himself
through the airlock and slammed
the massive door behind him.</p>

<p>He ran through the metal corridors
to the control room. They
must be on the ladder, he thought,
prying at the airlock with their
metal swords. He pressed switches,
slammed down on the throttle, and
the sweet music of the rockets came
and pressed him into his seat.</p>

<p>He looked down at the planet
dwindling into space below him
and he laughed hysterically, thinking
of the narrow escape he'd had.
No more planets for him, no more
trying to skin anyone.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"There it</span> goes," the Space Patrolman
said, watching the rocket
rise.</p>

<p>Harding trembled with helpless
rage. "That blasted fool Sheckly'll
lead you right to the money, too,"
he complained.</p>

<p>"That's the way we planned it,"
the Patrolman smiled. "I must compliment
our native friends on their
fine acting. Your pal took off like
a scared rabbit."</p>

<p>"Yeah," Harding grimaced,
clenching his fists as though wishing
he had someone's neck in them.</p>

<p>"Don't blame your friend too
much," the Patrolman advised.
"Whether you realize it or not, the
fact that you were consciously
avoiding our schedules caused you
to follow a pattern in your visits
to these outerspace planets; we just
figured a bit ahead of you and
posted hidden patrols on all the
inhabited planets in this sector,
knowing that sooner or later you'd
land on one of them. We spotted
your ship last night and hurried
over by 'copter so we wouldn't be
seen."</p>

<p>"Forget the synopsis," Harding
growled. "You walked in when
these blasted lizards were making
believe they were going to skin me
alive. They didn't have to act so
realistic about it."</p>

<p>"You're wrong about one thing,"
the Patrolman said. "The act didn't
start until after we arrived to direct
it."</p>

<p>Harding looked at him, puzzled.
"What do you mean by that?"</p>

<p>"We arrived, as the books say,
just in time," the Patrolman told
him. "They <i>weren't</i> making believe."
He offered a bowl of fruit
to his prisoner. "We'll be here for
another hour yet. Eat something."</p>

<p>Weakly, Harding shook his head
no. He sat down, suddenly pale at
what the officer had said.</p>

<p>He didn't feel very hungry.</p>
